# The Hierarchy of Productivity

[Shawn Blanc](https://shawnblanc.net/newsletter/):

> - Least Important: Tips, tricks, hacks, and shortcuts.
> 
> - Very Important: Habits and routines. Your daily actions and behavior. Your system of execution.
> 
> - Most Important: Vision and values. Your purpose, your priorities, your why.
