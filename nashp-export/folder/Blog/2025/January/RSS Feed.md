# Updated RSS Feed

If you’re subscribed to my [RSS](nashp.com/feed.rss), you’ve missed the last few posts. I just fixed the issue, so you’ll start seeing when I post. And if you missed the [announcement](https://nashp.com/2025-0117-1045) post, I’ve also updated the [homepage](https://nashp.com) to the site.

Here’s a recap so far:

- [I Have Died Many Times](https://nashp.com/2025-0117-1045)
- [A Simple Folder Structure](https://nashp.com/20250121 "A Simple Folder Structure")
- [Snow Day](https://nashp.com/250122 "Snow Day")
