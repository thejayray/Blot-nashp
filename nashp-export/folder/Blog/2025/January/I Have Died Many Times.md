# I Have Died Many Times

A new year. A new way to approach my writing. I hope you enjoy this new format. Going back to my roots. Blogging instead of weekly newsletters. This will remove the pressure of deadlines, which will also give me the freedom to create again, instead of fitting thoughts into a defined package due at the end of every week. Expect a more stream of conscious type of approach here now.

At the beginning of the last few years, I have enjoyed rereading [I Have Died Many Times, by CGP Grey](https://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/i-have-died-many-times). Let’s start my return here with that.

---- 

My [weekly newsletter](https://nashp.com/mc) that showed up in inboxes every Monday morning and lasted 137 weeks in a row is now over. When closing out last year, at first I only wanted to take a break during December, but as Christmas rolled around, and the new year approached, I knew that chapter of my life was over.

I’m ready for something new, and I think getting back to blogging (and microblogging) will scratch that itch for me. I’ll be able to build faster, with fresher ideas, and ultimately be more nimble with creating than those newsletters allowed me to be.

With no deadlines, you’ll now see more thoughts from me, or sometimes less, depending on the flow of that week. I can post immediately or not post at all for days or weeks. Only showing up when I have something to share.
