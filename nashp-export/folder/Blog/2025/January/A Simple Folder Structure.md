# A Simple Folder Structure

![](https://imgur.com/gFUMSvt.jpg)

I spent some time cleaning up folders during this rare snow day we had today. To organize these folders, I’m using the [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/). 

PARA has four main folders:

- Projects
- Areas
- Resources
- Archive

I made a folder today named “1.21.25 - Archive” and dragged any loose files I saw lying around into that dated archive folder. After, I moved “1.21.25 - Archive” into the main Archive folder. From there, I started grabbing anything related to my album and moved into the Nomad folder in Projects.

Here’s a glimpse of the folder structure for my new album. While organizing, I learned that I had 116 drafts/ideas already recorded.

[Get in touch](mailto:nashp@me.com) if you want to hear a few drafts. I’m open to feedback as I build out this album’s story.
