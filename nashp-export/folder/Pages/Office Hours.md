## About Office Hours

Office Hours is a tribute to the past, and a love letter to the future. The nostalgia of a cassette tape, with the speed of tomorrow. With only ten songs per session, each volume tells a simple story about connecting dots.

## [Office Hours 5][8]

03/29/23 - Parental Advisory. Explicit Content. This is Hip-Hop elite. Digging through their catalogs and finding the deeper cuts, instead of the popular and trendy tracks. The songs around their popular songs were always more appealing to me.

Volume 5 is dedicated to that.

(Gone until the summer. See you soon.)

## [Office Hours 4][9]

03/23/23 - Volume 4 is dedicated to static and distortion. When a musician uses it the right way, there’s an exciting energy that flows through the speakers. A grungy, rebellious sound that makes your ears perk up. 

I’m fascinated by all the decisions that go into curating a playlist. I’m fascinated by listening to the ending one track and hearing how it flows into the next. I’m fascinated by the blending of genres. Welcome to Office Hours. Hope you like what I’ve been up to.

## [Office Hours 3][10]

03/17/23 - Welcome to Office Hours. This time around, I wanted to curate a softer, more introspective set of songs. I get lost in my thoughts with a lot of these. Volume 3 comes in right at 34 minutes.

## [Office Hours 2][11]

03/10/23 - On Volume 1, I spent most of my energy building the infrastructure for the series, and didn’t get to laser in on cohesiveness of the songs as much as I would’ve liked. That changes with Volume 2. The tones and the vibe is sonically intact this time around. From completely different genres and release dates, these ten songs are somehow woven and connected through the universe. Volume 2 paints a more vivid picture of what Office Hours is designed to be. I’m excited to take this next step in the series.
