##### Press reply. [Say hello.][2]

###### Good morning. Spent the past few hours writing this newsletter for you at the last minute (instead of through the weekend). Been a busy week for me, with getting off work late, and then running, recording music, and streaming (more on that later). All good problems though. Searching for balance. As always, I hope this letter finds you well.

# Preparing for the Stars

### This week on Morning Coffee, I’m learning how to live stream and preparing for Starfield.

## Learning How to Live Stream

An area that I’ve been interested in for years is live streaming. With my office complete, all the equipment in place, and with a work from home job, now feels like a good time to start building out this setup. 

I have a [Twitch account][7] that I’m starting to work on. It’s mostly me experimenting and troubleshooting (with different visuals, scenes, and sounds). Once everything’s in place though, I plan to make it a 24/7 channel.

Ideas I have for streaming:

- My [discography][8] looping
- Writing my [newsletter][9]
- Working on new music
- Gaming with a webcam
- Pixilated cam while I work
- Looping YouTube playlists

This would be different than the way most people live stream, but I think it would make sense with the way I have such a variety of creative projects each week.

[Let me know][10] what you think or if you have any experience with streaming.

## Preparing For the Stars

- [Gameplay trailer][11]
- [45 minute deep dive][12]

With less than a month to go, I’ve been preparing for [Starfield][13], from the team that brought you Skyrim and Fallout. Skyrim in space is the way to think about this one. The two videos I linked to above shows you how massive this game will be. 

For the equipment, I have the Series X, Starfield controller, and a stand from Etsy. I’m aiming to have my streaming setup complete before launch, so I can [document][14] my journey through the stars.

[Let me know][15] if you’re anticipating Starfield.

## Apps I’m Using

- [Callsheet][16]
- [Streamlabs][17]
- [OBS][18]
- [Twitch][19]

[Callsheet][20] was released today by Casey Liss, and it serves the purpose of replacing IMDb with a cleaner and simpler version. That pitch alone is worth trying it out.

[Streamlabs][21] and [OBS][22] are the two apps I’ve been bouncing back and forth from as I learn how to live stream on [Twitch][23]. Each one has its pros and cons, but I’m hoping to settle into OBS once I can get it to do a few things that I can do is Streamlabs.
