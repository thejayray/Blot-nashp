##### Press reply. [Say hello.][2]

###### Currently in a coffee shop [30 minutes away][3], the sky is black, with lightning striking nearby, lighting up the entire coffee shop every few seconds. The pulsing sounds of [brain.fm][4] is in the AirPods. For a writer, this is the exact setting we imagine when we start typing. I hope this letter finds you well.

# Synthesizer

### This week on Morning Coffee, I write about how I’m taking notes, the changes I’ve made with social media, and what apps I’m using.

## Synthesizer

I recently started a new deep-dive into becoming a better notetaker: my lifelong journey of collecting thoughts and doing something with them. 

This process is a combination of tedious and liberating work. Living inside of [Ulysses][5], connecting dots, and synthesizing old ideas with new ones.

Ulysses Groups is where I’m doing all of the work. Making new groups for new topics, and connecting those groups with other related ones, while having it all fold easily inside of a main category. I’m really enjoying how things are coming out.

**Resources:**

- [How to Take Smart Notes][6]
- [Building a Second Brain][7]
- [The PARA Method (book)][8]
- [The PARA Method (video)][9]
- [How to Take Smart Notes (video)][10]

## Social Shifts

I recently decided to delete some accounts from the internet:

- Mastodon
- Reddit
- Twitter

The accounts are now completely gone. I no longer need them, and once I realized that, deleting the entire account felt pretty easy. 

- [Reeder][11] for news. 
- [Threads][12] for social.
- Nothing else.

## Apps I’m Using

- [Brain.fm][13] has been playing for me in the background lately. It’s a tool that I used many years ago, and thanks to my lifetime membership, I’m using it again. Forgot how helpful this is for staying focused. “Brain.fm’s functional music is designed from the bottom up to affect your brain and optimize your performance.”

- [Timery][14] has been running in the background all week as well, making sure that I’m being efficient with my time. It not only helps with being intentional, it also gives me data to look back on when the day’s over.

My wife wants this to be my only job, so [pay][15] what you want, purchase my books on [Amazon][16], or join my [Music Program][17].
