###### Good morning. The sun just went down as I walk home from the coffee shop. Just finished a two-hour writing session. Two of the three topics will be saved for next week. Beautiful weekend with the family: Couch shopping, seafood lunch date, and teaching Rose how to skate for the first time. Finally feeling healthy again. As always, I [hope][2] this letter finds you well.

## Trading Tech

For the past three months, I’ve been trading with people from around the world. I made a list of all the devices that were in my office: What I’m keeping and what I’m getting rid of.

I spent most of last year building out my office, and now that I have a clear understanding of what’s actually needed in there, I’m able to replace anything redundant with just two devices.

1. [Steam Deck][3] replacing Xbox, Nintendo Switch, [and][4] Retroid Pocket 2S.
2. [M2 MacBook Air][5] replacing an M1 MacBook Air and M2 Mac mini.

## The Process

I used three apps to make this process happen:

1. Reddit
2. Facebook
3. OfferUp

Throughout the week, I would hunt down the product I was looking for and attempt to negotiate with the person selling them. As expected, most people only wanted cash, but I knew that for the right person, this deal would make sense.

## The Big Trade

And then *The Big Trade* happened:

1. M1 MacBook Air
2. M2 Mac mini
3. Elgato capture card
4. Deity USB Microphone

I turned those four items into a brand new [M2 MacBook Air][6]. Once the deal was agreed upon, I drove two hours away to complete the trade.

## The Roster

Throughout this process, I felt like an NBA General Manager, trading role players for an elite scorer.

Computers:

- iPhone
- iPad mini
- MacBook Air

Consoles:

- Miyoo mini
- Steam Deck
- PlayStation 5

The roster is now complete.
