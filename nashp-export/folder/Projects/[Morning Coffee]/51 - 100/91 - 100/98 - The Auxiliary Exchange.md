###### Good morning. Writing you on this beautiful afternoon, the day before sending out this email.  The power is currently out at my house. [Transformer](https://i.giphy.com/Bf3Anv7HuOPHEPkiOx.webp) blew up near me. Thankfully, we have a generator that powers the entire house. Been playing a few games on the Steam Deck this week: [Ships of Harkinian](https://www.shipofharkinian.com/), [Pacific Drive](https://www.pacificdrivegame.com/), and [Helldivers 2](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/). Also been streaming on my [new](https://nashp.com/gg) page. I have most of this next week off. Looking forward to a trip to Nola and working on a big project for the house. As always, [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## My Gaming Journey

I made a [gaming page](https://nashp.com/gg) that has two things on it: A timeline of all my favorite games I’ve played throughout my life, and a video player for when I’m streaming.

This page was inspired by the photo above, from 1989, when I opened up my first Nintendo for Christmas.

I went from that moment forward and started researching the best games of each year since, making notes of each game I remember playing at that time.

From 1989 to 2024: take a look at [my gaming journey](https://nashp.com/gg).

## The Auxiliary Exchange

In iOS 17.3, Apple released a new feature for Apple Music that allows you to [collaborate](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-collaborative-apple-music-playlists/) with others. I immediately took advantage of this. While on a [hiking trip](https://nashp.com/91), I thought of the name and concept, *The Auxiliary Exchange*, and then I invited my two friends to join me (not realizing that I was on the 17.3 beta, so I had the feature before they did). Six weeks later, here we are with [Part 1](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/the-auxiliary-exchange-1/pl.u-oZylKLgsR8KmKP) (and Part 2 is already prepped to begin).

The concept for this project is simple: three friends ([Nash](https://music.apple.com/profile/nashp), [Richard](https://music.apple.com/profile/richardjonessw), [Jordan](https://music.apple.com/profile/jordansteib10)) passing the aux cord as if we’re in the same room together. Three different times (plus a simple intro to kick things off), equals ten songs, which equals a little mixtape.

There’s a few things that make creating The Auxiliary Exchange satisfying: making sure your song blends well with the one before it, delivering an element of surprise, and best of all, collaborating with likeminded ears. I hope you steal this idea with your friends.
