###### Good evening. Writing you while watching Daddy Finger on tv. Rose is jumping from her stool to the bean bag, over and over (all while running around without a diaper, as she potty trains). Enjoying this three-day weekend by doing house projects (empty workshop, remodeled bathroom) and playing [Wind Waker](https://youtu.be/SFoq7xzaF60?si=EYqNBGhY8Vm116aF) on the [Pocket 2S](https://www.goretroid.com/cdn/shop/products/548f6dfeb36e615cc62903b4eed35ece_1512x.jpg?v=1690194805) (most of the playing was tinkering to add mods to graphics and gameplay). As always, [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## A Refreshed Calendar

Look close at this screenshot. Notice how many jobs this one app is doing for me: Countdown, habit tracker, reminders, and a work schedule that can hide in the background, all inside of this little [calendar](https://www.hey.com/calendar/).

## Farewell Artifact

Artifact is [shutting down](https://medium.com/artifact-news/shutting-down-artifact-1e70de46d419). I’ve been using it for the last few months to post little segments from the newsletter, and because of that, I was hitting record numbers each month since. It was the first “social media” app that worked for me that well. And now it’s gone. Was good while it lasted.
