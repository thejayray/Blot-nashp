###### Good evening. Writing you while walking downtown. Headed to the marina. The sun is going down. Cool breeze. Beanie, hoodie, jacket weather. The AirPods fill my ears with [Jazzie Robinson](https://music.apple.com/us/album/jazzie-robinson/1261676243). It’s been a busy weekend for us. 4am roadtrip to another state. More on that below. As always, [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) all is well.

## Zelda on the iPhone

I’ve been playing Zelda on my iPhone lately, thanks to [Afterplay](https://afterplay.io/): a simple website that lets you upload retro [games](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=zelda+rom&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 "zelda rom") into your account and play them on any screen. It even auto-saves as you play.

## Dots and Boxes

Even with all the technology in this world (and in my office), year after year, my favorite possession continues to be [Field Notes](https://www.amazon.com/stores/FieldNotes/page/4B783A05-96E3-4FC2-9F25-76EDE756BD96?ref_=ast_bln). It doesn’t matter what the latest gadget is, nothing compares to this little notebook in my pocket.

I’ve used hundreds of Field Notes over the years, and during that time, I’ve slowly built a very simple system for capturing: **Dots and Boxes**.

- Dots for notes
- Boxes for tasks

This is what I call **Rapid Logging**. Current date at the top, bullet points for thoughts, checkboxes for actions. I can be anywhere in the world, pull this little notebook out and have two pages like this completely full in less than five minutes. It’s the ultimate tool for clarity.
