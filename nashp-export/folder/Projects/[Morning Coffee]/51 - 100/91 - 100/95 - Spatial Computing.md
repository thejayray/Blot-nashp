###### Good morning. Writing you from New Orleans. With my wife, about to eat lunch. Currently sitting near a dressing room as she tries on piles of clothes. Just finished my private demo of [Apple Vision](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/). Hard to wrap my head around what I just experienced. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Life Updates

- It’s been awhile since I’ve shared an update to my office. Here’s a photo of how my desk looks now. I spend most of my days here looking at these two screens for work.

- The hardcover version of my [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQQG3JCF?binding=paperback&ref=dbs_dp_awt_sb_pc_tpbk), When the Satellite Fell, arrived this past week. Now I want all my books to be primarily in hardcover.

- I had way more [subscribers](https://nashp.com/mc) in January than I was expecting. I’m still seeing a steady growth each month, despite [Artifact](https://nashp.com/92) going away. Thank you (and [say hello](mailto:nashp@me.com)).

- Between vacation, [bereavement](https://youtu.be/nawzNd2O2TY?si=qUdfNjFyrVXGCdbC), and my elbow, I haven’t worked in a few weeks. Feel myself getting rejuvenated more and more each day.

## Spatial Computing

[Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/) is here. As I’m writing this, I’m currently in New Orleans, getting a private demo of the headset. I don’t recommend anyone buy this first version yet, but you should learn about it and educate yourself on it. The technology inside of this is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before.

This is a small glimpse into the future. Similar to how the world changed after the iPhone was released, Apple Vision will change how we see the world around us.

Here’s a few videos I recommend:

- [Vision Pro in NYC](https://youtu.be/UvkgmyfMPks?si=DYtwwKEFLon5_iV9)
- [What it’s like using](https://youtu.be/dtp6b76pMak?si=4Plg9QlhoMfSw7eO)
