###### Good morning. At the coffee shop with Rose. Wrapping up this letter. This one is a mixture of little things. No major topic. Been working on a few projects in the background though: preparing for next week’s 100th newsletter, organizing terabytes of storage, editing wedding photos, and the newest project, a new [album](https://nashp.com/music) of leftover material from over the years. The last few days have been eventful: New Orleans trip with Olivia, Dune 2 in IMAX, Marriage Night at church, a friend’s wedding, editing wedding photos in Lightroom, church, family day at the park. So many good days in a row. Also was able to play basketball three times this past week. Haven’t played in months, thanks to several injuries. Feels good to be back. As always, [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Apps I’m Using

- [Looks Like Rain](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6443960587): At a glance, see if it’s raining that day. My new favorite weather app.

- [Up Ahead](https://upaheadapp.com/): Has become my primary calendar.

- [Apple Sports](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-sports/id6446788829): Apple just release a sports score app. Only sports app I need now.

- [Infuse](https://firecore.com/infuse): Signing into a [Plex](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/) account inside of this app is the best way to watch TV now. Hands down. I now have this app on all of my devices (iPhone, iPad, Apple TV).

- [Simple Scan](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simple-scan-quick-scanner/id6477965455): Best scanning app out there. Clean, simple, and powerful. Made by [Greg Pierce](https://agiletortoise.com/).

## What I’m Watching

- [Dune: Part Two](https://youtu.be/U2Qp5pL3ovA?si=XVsOKzKocNhpW9S-): Watched this at the IMAX with my wife (and I’ll be going see it again in a few days with my dad). One of the best movies I’ve ever seen.

- [Shogun](https://youtu.be/HIs9x49DK7I?si=gwUwNMI5-YZc36Rr): FX’s new series. Reminds me of Game of Thrones in a lot of ways. Looking forward to digging into this more.

- [Better Call Saul](https://youtu.be/l1xIGfVFb-U?si=5J2VO9Cgb3IbCiVs): Been having this playing in the background throughout the week.

## What I’m Playing

- [Octopath Traveler II](https://youtu.be/lgmLN1NHXyE?si=teLp9IFcfwiw-M9l): Been enjoying this game. A turn-based story, that I can play at my own pace. Playing as Osvald V. Vanstein, “one of eight playable characters and the possible main protagonist of Octopath Traveler II. A once noble scholar, he was framed by his colleague for the murder of his own family. After spending more than five years in prison, he has planned a prison break so he can avenge his fallen kin.”

- [NBA 2K24](https://youtu.be/OJS1BVniz5c?si=vT5eXkWF_PR7Ftl7): Learning how to play this game again.
