###### Good evening. It’s Christmas Eve, and it’s pouring down raining. Very cozy. Currently just finished a long nap, popcorn, and The Polar Express with Rose. This week’s newsletter will be really simple. Just a list of everything that happened this year. As always, I hope this letter finds you well. Merry Christmas.
