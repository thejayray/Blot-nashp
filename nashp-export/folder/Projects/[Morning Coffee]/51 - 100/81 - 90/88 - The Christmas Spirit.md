###### Good evening. Just finished drinking an Eggnog latte as I wrap up this week’s newsletter. I hear the jazz instruments in the background. All I Want For Christmas Is You, by [Kirk Whalum][3]. About to step into the office to add some finishing touches to the two poetry [books][4] that’ll be released next week. I’ve edited the printed drafts a few more times than I originally expected, but I want them just right before releasing them to the world on Amazon. What I’ve learned from these two books will be recreated over a dozen times for the rest of the poetry books. That’s the exciting part. This is just the beginning. As always, [I hope][5] this letter finds you well.

## The Christmas Spirit

During the first week of November, we decided to buy a new tree and set it up earlier than usual. I took that as a challenge to keep the Christmas music and movies playing for the next two months.

All the good holiday movies have been playing in the living room, either in the background as we’re doing other things, or with us gathered on the couch as a family.

I also found a playlist that I love on Apple Music called [Instrumental Holiday][7]. All the classic Christmas songs, as only instrumentals. Simple jazz and folk melodies. These sounds have been playing throughout the house and backyard, at the same time, thanks to all the HomePods sprinkled around.

During this next week, we’ll be wrapping presents, baking sugar cookies, drinking eggnog, and bringing the kids to see the lights in New Orleans. Combine that with this ten-day vacation and I think I found a perfect recipe for the Christmas spirit.
