###### [Good Morning!][2] The sun just came up. At the nearby coffee shop. Americano. Writing inside of [Things][3] (My new system is fascinating. Been using it in so many new creative ways). This week’s newsletter is the beginning of a new season. Feeling rejuvenated. A lot of new things to look forward to. I’ll explain why today. Hope this letter finds you well. Let’s begin.

#### The Box (For Your Consideration). As I’m putting the finishing touches on this newsletter, I look down to add this current song to a playlist, and it’s the same name as today’s newsletter ([Open Field by Kiln][4]). Your Honor finale. Snowfall. YouTube Premium. So many desk setup videos. [Austin Kleon][5]: “The journal is not so much a way of diarizing one’s life, but a portable studio, a place where you can hang out, with your imagination, your intuition, your inspiration.” What is the end goal? ([John Gruber][6] discusses AI and the future of our world in his latest podcast. Incredible discussion.) [Tiago Forte][7]: “The only way to change your life is one project at a time.”

# An Open Field

### This week I discuss how an open field for a child, and a blank canvas for an artist, are similar. I also breakdown the new season. April brings in the 2nd quarter. Let’s talk about it.

## Quarter Number 2

The second quarter is here. A fresh start. We’re a few days into April. This will be one of the biggest seasons I’ve had in a while. My office is done. I’ll be moving everything in this week. My new job starts in two weeks. Working from home in that office. My wife just shot her first wedding and is now editing thousands of photos. I’m excited to see the finished product of that job, and to see where this new adventure takes her. A lot of things happening in my life at once. The momentum is right where I need it to be.

## An Open Field

A few days ago, I took Rose to a nearby park. We didn’t go on the swing or the slide like usual. Instead, I introduced her to an empty field where she can just run around. She picked flowers, and relaxed in the grass for over an hour.

An open field makes me think of the blank canvas we have as artists. Rose puts her hands out like a little airplane and begins running as fast as she can (which looks pretty much the same as her normal walk, but with a little more aggression), and that’s what creating looks like. We put our hands out, and we attempt to fly. Sometimes we’re barely moving, even though we’re going through the motions. But sometimes, when the universe is just right, we arrive at that perfect altitude. And that’s why we keep showing up. Knowing that the next time might be the one.
