##### Press reply. [Say hello][2].

###### Good morning! Alarm clock went off a few minutes ago. Still dark outside. Fixed my coffee and walked into my new office to begin writing. My new work from home job starts today. That’ll take some getting used to, but I’m excited for this new chapter. For that reason (and a big photo project I have to finish up),  I’ll keep this week short. Let’s begin.

# Every Monday For An Entire Year

![][image-4]

A year ago, I decided to start handcrafting a weekly story. A newsletter that shows up every Monday morning, in your inbox and on my website. I wanted it to feel like a tight package of thoughts. Like a mini-magazine, with editor’s notes and a variety of topics. 

Today celebrates the anniversary of starting this newsletter. I’m proud to say that I haven’t missed a single Monday. A few of the weeks were more stressful than others (due to traveling), but for the most part, they were all pretty easy. This let’s me know that I’m doing something right. I show up once a week, and then say goodbye until the following Monday. The agreement is simple.

Since starting, I’ve slowly refined the layout and the process of building out this newsletter. The whole system feels solid and has been molded to fit all the layers of my personality. Any cool thought or problem that I’m trying to solve now has a home inside of this system. This also helps any lingering thoughts that would’ve been stuck on repeat if I didn’t have an outlet. Showing up weekly closes those loops. 

Morning Coffee. One year old now. Thanks to having this weekly process, it’s made me a much better person, writer, and thinker.

### This is Morning Coffee: a weekly newsletter that arrives in your inbox every Monday morning. I write about productivity, technology, and cool things I find on the internet. My wife wants this to be my only job, so [pay][7] what you want, purchase my books on [Amazon][8], or join my [Music Program][9].
