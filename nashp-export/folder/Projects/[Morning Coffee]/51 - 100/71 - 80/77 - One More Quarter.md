###### Good Morning! Downtown Jeaux with Rose. Today will be a simple write up. Just a few lists and quick thoughts. This week on Morning Coffee, I write about how I’ve adjusted my calories to burn, share my Home Screen, my morning routine with Rose, and a photo of my desk. Hope this letter finds you well.

# One More Quarter

We’re now finished with 3/4 of the year. Third quarter is over. One more to go. A lot of holidays (Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas) and birthdays (Rose and Olivia) coming up. Starting to wrap up plans I had for the year. Starting to prepare for the following year. Take a moment this morning and reflect on how you want to close out these next three months.

## 100 Down

I dropped my calories to burn on my watch by 100, to gain back some time, and to see how it affects my weight and routine. With filling my rings every single day of the year so far, that last 100 calories was always an inconvenience. Curious to see how this change helps/hurts me.
