###### Good morning and Happy Labor Day. The kettle is heating up. The coffee will be in the thermos soon. A few days ago, I saw that it was about to rain, so I decided to take the family out for a picnic. Interesting choice. Knowing that it was about to rain didn’t stop us from making lunch a little more adventurous. We packed sandwiches and snacks and set out to a nearby park. As soon as we started eating, the rain started pouring down around us. Rose ate chips and watched as the rain surrounded our shelter. Once we were done eating, I ran through the rain to pack everything back up. Olivia held the umbrella over Rose’s head and walked slowly back to the car. A simple picnic, collaborating with Mother Nature, to create fun memories for the family. This is Morning Coffee 125. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Hollow Nights

It’s been almost a month now since I’ve written a big idea for the newsletter. Usually I have topics lined up for weeks, but the writing just isn’t there right now. Instead, I’m supplementing the big ideas with a couple smaller ones.

Life has been a little different for my family lately, so the lack of writing makes sense. My mind is on other priorities. So if you’re here, and you notice things have been a little hollow, thats why. Stick around though: When you notice the newsletter hitting on all cylinders again, you’ll know that things are back to normal.

[Reach](mailto:nashp@me.com) out to help with inspiration or to discuss what’s been going on.

## Two Outliers

I recently [wrote](https://nashp.com/122) about my current Watch face, and this is a follow-up. A week ago, the watch showed two outliers (lack of sleep and lower respiratory rate), and on the other side it showed my training (exercise) was lower than usual. Thanks to this new face, I’m able to see at a glance areas that need improvement.

## The Talk Show

This week’s writing was inspired by the latest episode of [The Talk Show](https://overcast.fm/+AAB7NCLse6A), where [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net) and special guest Taegan Goddard, longtime writer and founder of [Political Wire](https://politicalwire.com), talk about the past, present, and future of independent media.

## What I’m Watching

[The Forever Winter](https://youtu.be/P9u7s_cwVYw?si=EAORdGDueUAQqC_8) is exactly what I’m looking for right now. [Land of Bad](https://youtu.be/yTFazxfrXVw?si=Dq9gmPXrZ_fUaTme) was a good survival war movie. [Crescent City](https://youtu.be/jrI-8ScanDQ?si=plIpgqU9w04Mg5hm) was a good detective thriller. [Trap](https://youtu.be/hJiPAJKjUVg?si=V90D9cCX8Z1qjhI7) was one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen. [Cinematic Game 6](https://youtu.be/lyJ6GyC4Yng?si=wYPtAwuejDarASUh) is a great way to watch Jordan in the playoffs.
