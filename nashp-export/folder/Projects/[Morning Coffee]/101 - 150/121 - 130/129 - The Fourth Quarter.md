### [Morning Coffee 129: Sept. 30th, 2024](https://nashp.com/129)

---- 

###### Today’s letter is brought to you by [Analog](https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog) cards (Almost done with today’s agenda). A few days ago, cajun steaks were cooking inside while a bonfire and s’mores were outside. The music in the background was perfect (I turned it into a [playlist](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/september-28th-2024/pl.u-2aoqrayhN49j9V) to share). It’s been awhile, but the season has finally changed for me (I’ll share more soon). This is Morning Coffee 129. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## The Fourth Quarter

We’re in the final stretch of the year:

- October
- November
- December

For the last few months, my family has been adjusting to some changes. It’s finally behind us now. Just in time for the fourth quarter. I’ll use that momentum to close out the year. A lot to be thankful for. A lot to look forward to. How do you want to remember 2024? What are some goals you want to accomplish before the year is over?

## Photo Shuffle

Did you know that you can see a different photo each time you raise your wrist? On your phone, go to the Watch app, Face Gallery, and then choose Photos. From there, you’ll select Shuffle, and then decide what type of photos you’d like to use. For mine, I chose People, and then selected Rose. Now each time I glance at my wrist, I see a different photo of my daughter.

## Scavenger

A war is happening around you. There’s an explosion to your left. Grab the components from that fallen drone over there. Soldiers are surveying the area. Remain hidden and don’t engage. Don’t use your weapon. It’s not strong enough to matter. You’re just a scavenger. Find water to bring home and extract immediately. This is [The Forever Winter](https://youtu.be/0NfKoPmWvac?si=k_Yk5t3LE2H87NOc).
