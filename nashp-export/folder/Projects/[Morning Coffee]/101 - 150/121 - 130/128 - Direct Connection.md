### [Morning Coffee 128: Sept. 23rd, 2024](https://nashp.com/128)

---- 

###### Today’s cup of coffee is brought to you by [My Neighbor Totoro](https://youtu.be/HaLISMAGdOE?si=kg7mGuYC7FV1eMWg). It’s playing in the background as I finish this letter. Rose watches this over and over, and I don’t mind because it’s that good. A few days ago, we went to the Hero Fest in our town, where Rodney Atkins performed, and Rose rode her first fair ride all by herself. She had a big smirk and was so impressed that she didn’t need any help. Proud dad moment. This is Morning Coffee 128. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Direct Connection

I visited the Mall of Louisiana last week with my sister, during the iPhone launch. She bought herself the new [Desert Titanium 16 Pro](https://www.apple.com/iphone-16-pro/). Besides waiting in line, the purchasing process only took us five minutes. Picked the color, picked the case, swiped the card. After eating lunch, I did all the setting up from the passenger seat. I plugged my phone in to show GPS, and then turned on my hotspot to give the new phone an internet connection.

When initially setting up an iPhone, the trick is [Quick Start](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102659). Most people are worried about their iCloud backup, but that’s not what I use to transfer. From Quick Start, choose the second option to transfer directly from previous device. This process only requires both phones (old and new) to stay close to each other as the transfer completes.

By the time we arrived back home, her new phone was identical to her old one, and even her SIM card, which was a physical card before, was now converted to an eSim. All from the passenger seat without a WiFi connection.

## Street Tacos

A few nights ago, We used the [Mela](https://mela.recipes/) app on the iPad to make street tacos. Mela takes any recipe you find online and saves that recipe into a simple layout. I’ve tried many apps like this, most are bloated with features that I’ll never use. Mela is the only one you need.

## Echoes of Wisdom

I’m a few hours into [Echoes of Wisdom](https://youtu.be/94RTrH2erPE?si=kL71fPFZ_mVHiseL) and it’s already one of my favorite Zelda games. It’s a mixture of new (Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom) and old Zelda (Link’s Awakening, A Link to the Past). You play as Princess Zelda this time around, instead of Link, and you’re on an adventure to save Hyrule. The exploring, puzzle solving, and story have all been a blast so far.
