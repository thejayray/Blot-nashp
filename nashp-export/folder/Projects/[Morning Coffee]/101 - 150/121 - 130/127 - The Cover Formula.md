### [Morning Coffee 127: Sept. 16th, 2024](https://nashp.com/127)

---- 

###### Today’s cup of coffee is brought to you by [Aeropress](https://aeropress.com/). It was just a few days ago, five us were huddled up in one room with mattresses covering the entire floor. A window unit was providing air condition, while the generator was blaring outside, keeping the lights on until our city recovered from the hurricane. There’s an adventurous and bonding spirit in the air during a storm. Strategizing meals, kids jumping on mattresses, Rose bumping her head while jumping and now has a black eye, spending quality time with my little brother, and getting tons of hours in on the [Death Stranding](https://youtu.be/4DUXHGEKS00?si=azvRM9VkRe8-3oi1) (Steam Deck). There’s nothing out there quite like Death Stranding. This is Morning Coffee 127. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Follow the Storm

During Hurricane Francine, I used a combination of [Weather Up](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/weather-up-live-widgets/id1196015787) and [Looks Like Rain](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/looks-like-rain/id6443960587) to follow the storm. [Weather Up](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/weather-up-live-widgets/id1196015787) was great for seeing the hurricane’s trajectory, and [Looks Like Rain](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/looks-like-rain/id6443960587) helped me see how much rain was left.

## The Cover Formula

Thanks to [GoDaddy Studio](https://apps.apple.com/app/id535811906), I now have a template to easily make a cover photo for each week’s newsletter. Once I find a photo that I like, I bring it into the [Studio](https://apps.apple.com/app/id535811906) app, go to my cover photo project, replace the previous photo with a new one, and then edit the top font’s color to match the new photo’s color palette. A simple way to personalize each week’s cover.

## The Hot Topic

[iOS 18](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-18/) is now released. Here’s all [all 250 features](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-18/pdf/iOS_18_All_New_Features_Sept_2024.pdf) (My favorites features are the Passwords app, the new Photos app, and the ability to [hide your apps](https://nashp.com/118)). Currently reading Federico Viticci’s annual iOS [review](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-18-the-macstories-review/).

The PS5 Pro was [announced](https://www.youtube.com/live/X24BzyzQQ-8?si=AvyRfRJFqcGnCOgs) last week. Kendrick Lamar released a [new song](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_y8-rrS5La/?igsh=MW9qb2JrdWpneXdsNw==) on his Instagram that feels like a State of the Union/Culture. Prior to this song, he [announced](https://youtu.be/oIEKK_j0fss?si=L8nZo_D-SHh6Nbv-) that he was headlining the Super Bowl.
