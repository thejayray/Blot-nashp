###### Good morning. Hario v60 coffee in Stanley thermos. Admin time. Lots of little tasks inside of [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) this morning. Prepping for a busy week with big changes on the horizon. Played basketball twice last week (Aiming for three this week). Still running 5K a day. Watching [Industry](https://youtu.be/fV6BGl2YA04?si=BVpWvdIHRBoudRgj) and started playing [Detroit: Become Human](https://youtu.be/k6d4tM0zmVU?si=tfEl4IbbPdsM3GcD) for the first time. This is Morning Coffee 122. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Modular Ultra

My [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-ultra-2/?afid=p238%7CskM1iebvF-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_677549220957_pgrid_144143178673_pntwk_g_pchan__pexid__ptid_kwd-369013438007_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-watch--slid---product-) is always on my wrist, evening when sleeping, showering, or playing basketball. I consider the Apple Watch my most important computer, tracking all of my health data, and giving me important information with just a glance at my wrist.

The Watch face I’m using is Modular Ultra, an exclusive face to the Apple Watch Ultra. On the left side of the bezel shows my vitals (heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature, sleep duration, and blood oxygen). The right side of the bezel shows my training load (intensity and duration of workouts).

The top of the screen shows my messages, the day of the week, and the Watch’s battery life. The middle of the screen shows the time and my next calendar event. The bottom of the screen shows my exercise rings, any tasks for that day, and the weather conditions outside.
