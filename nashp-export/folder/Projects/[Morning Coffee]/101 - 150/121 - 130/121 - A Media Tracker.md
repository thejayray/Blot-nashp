###### Good morning. Writing you before going on my daily run (5K a day has been the goal lately). It’s been an interesting week for me, with lots of conversations about my career. On a related note, a cool milestone happened this week: one of my [songs](https://nashp.bandcamp.com/track/monster-in-my-head) was featured in a [movie](https://link.tubi.tv/Z7CjTnEeLLb) (You can watch the movie for [free](https://link.tubi.tv/Z7CjTnEeLLb) on Tubi. My song starts playing at the 25 minute mark). Tonight is the season finale of [House of the Dragon](https://youtu.be/DotnJ7tTA34?si=XD02HTuGNmLPkWCi). A few days ago, I binge watched the entire season of [Presumed Innocent](https://youtu.be/ZNSY3lMioHs?si=SfkPRFlBJvQoaptm). Been playing [Fallout 76](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en) (on PS5) and [Fallout 4](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/games/fallout-4) (on Steam Deck). This is Morning Coffee 121. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Sequel

[Sequel](https://www.getsequel.app) is an app that tracks the media you’re interested in (Similar to [Sofa](https://www.sofahq.com)). With Sequel, the main screen is divided into three simple sections: Games, Movies, and Series. Inside of the Movies and Series sections, there’s tabs to divide the Watchlist from the Watched. And for the Games section, the tabs are divided into Wishlist, Backlog, and Played. It all looks very clean and tidy.

My favorite feature in [Sequel](https://www.getsequel.app) is the way it uses Artificial Intelligence. When you’re on a website that mentions a movie you’re interested in, use the share sheet and send it Sequel. The app will analyze what’s on that webpage and bring up that movie inside of Sequel for you to add it to your collection. Such a seamless way to keep track of all your media.
