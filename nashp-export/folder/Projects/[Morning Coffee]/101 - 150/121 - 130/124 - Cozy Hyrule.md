###### Good morning. Hot coffee in the thermos. Writing you from inside of a Starbucks in New Orleans. Sade’s [By Your Side](https://youtu.be/C8QJmI_V3j4?si=x8aYlVLY7TftnmkA) is playing in the background. Rose and I are waiting for Olivia to finish taking her test, then going find lunch in NOLA. This is Morning Coffee 124. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## iPhone 16

>   Do you know the release date for the iPhone 16?

The iPhone 16 will be [announced](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/) September 9th. I expect preorders to be on the 13th, with the release date being the following week, on the 20th. Here’s what we know about the [16](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/) and the [16 Pro](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/) so far.

## Handhelds

> What retro handheld should I get right now?

I’m playing my retro games on the [Steam Deck OLED](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/oled) and the [RG28XX](https://anbernic.com/products/rg28xx?srsltid=AfmBOopE31WyTjHntVLefEDJqBGd20Uzl0ZiSHuWRClLIk7csDwIswDQ). If you’re looking to buy a handheld for retro games, I recommend buying is either the [SP](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xxsp?srsltid=AfmBOoo0ILytUn8bHyda1_9HEyJwPZUpo5T9VfK05mb4W8VB7d9_2CUo) or the [Retroid Pocket 4 Pro](https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-4-handheld?srsltid=AfmBOoqy7VxisgweRcnJAZIhLiRWP9P2DSDPljDwON8cz-7dOpzhzkcF). Use [minUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI) on the SP, and use [Daijisho](https://github.com/TapiocaFox/Daijishou) on the Retroid Pocket.

## [BlackBerry](https://youtu.be/S1cAlL78NTs?si=iojOwprvPfmUrswM)

> Two mismatched entrepreneurs - egghead innovator Mike Lazaridis and cut-throat businessman Jim Balsillie - joined forces in an endeavour that was to become a worldwide hit in little more than a decade. The story of the meteoric rise and catastrophic demise of the world's first smartphone.

This is the story before the iPhone. Highly recommend. Enjoyed every second.

## [Industry](https://youtu.be/fV6BGl2YA04?si=sdsLX59nR6v-zirz)

> In the cutthroat world of international finance, a group of young graduates compete for a limited set of permanent positions at a top investment bank in London. 

Industry is the modern day financial version of Game of Thrones. Politics and rising through the ranks.

## [Cozy Hyrule](https://youtu.be/Q7T6DCOYHis?si=7owGgGWTXasj0wfu)

I’ve been traveling the world of Hyrule again with [Breath of the Wild](https://youtu.be/1rPxiXXxftE?si=snEzao-vuokpmUJd) on the Steam Deck (Cemu). When [Tears of the Kingdom](https://youtu.be/uHGShqcAHlQ?si=iTnEE2dMzWstGzVF) launched, I thought Breath of the Wild was obsolete since they share so much in common, but after revisiting this game again, I couldn’t have been more wrong.

Tears of the Kingdom feels more futuristic and hectic in a lot of ways, where Breath of the Wild feels more  zen and one with nature.

I turned the hud off. The quality is upscaled to 2K. Added unlimited stamina mod, unlimited arrows mod, and a durability mod (so weapons don’t break). Now, climbing, swimming, running, and weapons feel more relaxing. In a lot of ways, I turned Breath of the Wild and Hyrule into a cozy game. All on the Steam Deck.
