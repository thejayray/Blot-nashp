### [Morning Coffee 130: Oct. 7th, 2024](https://nashp.com/130)

---- 

###### Good morning. It’s been a busy weekend for us (Seafood boil, church, birthday party, another church, pumpkin patch). Skipped running a few days last week (rain, basketball gyms closed, and schedule just completely filled up). But even with those days missed, thanks to the amount of basketball I’ve been playing, I feel lighter on my feet. Hoping to play a lot more basketball with my new schedule. This is Morning Coffee 130. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## A new chapter

Today’s the first day at my new job. A tech support position at our local hospital. Rose is also starting her first day of preschool today. I went tour the school with her last week and she has been talking about it ever since. This new job, and my daughter now going to school, will completely change our family’s daily routine, and I’m excited for this new chapter. I feel rejuvenated, and I’m ready to build on this momentum.

## Diablo IV

For gaming this month, I’ll be focusing completely on [Diablo IV](https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/). It matches the mood of October. What is Diablo? An action role-playing dungeon crawler. Create a character, explore, fight, collect loot (weapons and gear), and level up as you progress through the world. I’m learning why Diablo is so popular. The gameplay loop, customization, and progression feels like it’ll never end. My favorite part is that whether I play on the PlayStation 5 or the Steam Deck, my character and progress is carried over. This allows me to play on the go or on the big screen.
