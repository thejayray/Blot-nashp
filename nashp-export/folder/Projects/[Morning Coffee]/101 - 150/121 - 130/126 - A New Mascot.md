### [Morning Coffee 126: Sept. 9th, 2024](https://nashp.com/126)

###### Good morning. On my second cup of s’mores coffee. Rose is helping me work outside. We’re moving everything in the back apartment as we prepare for a potential Hurricane Francine. A few days ago we all got dressed early, went into the attic to get a gift bag, went to the store to buy a football for a gift, then headed to the trampoline park just in time for a birthday party…just to be told at the register that we’re a day early and should come back tomorrow. This is Morning Coffee 126. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Apple Event

The iPhone event just ended. They announced several new products:

[iPhone 16](https://youtu.be/GDlkCkcIqTs?si=3z6JnA4x-dhSfagU) and [iPhone 16 Pro](https://youtu.be/eDqfg_LexCQ?si=jpRSk1B8Z7BgCem7) now have built in [Apple Intelligence](https://youtu.be/Q_EYoV1kZWk?si=Xc34ggHQ2AST5YF8), and on the side of the phone there’s a Camera Control button, giving your phone a real camera shutter.

[Apple Watch Series 10](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-10/) is now thinner with a bigger screen, and can now play music straight from your wrist (a feature I’ve been waiting for since the watch first launched). And for health, it now has sleep apnea detection.

[AirPods 4](https://www.apple.com/airpods-4/) have a new design that brings features over from the Pro models, like Transparency Mode and Noise Cancellation.

## A New Mascot

To put it simple, [Astro Bot](https://youtu.be/unYFdcEjV9k?si=MZ8UNQCmtWXS-o2U) is the Playstation 5’s Super Mario. This feels like a love letter to gaming. The combination of eye-popping graphics and immersive controls will charm anyone that gets their hands on this little game. My family gathered around the living room, taking turns playing and collecting bots all weekend.

You land on a variety of planets with a list of what’s needed to be found. A handful of your friends are scattered and need your help. Your job is to find them and bring them back to the crash site. The concept is simple, but the process will hook you in until all three hundred bots are collected.

Sony has a new mascot and system-seller. It doesn’t get more refreshing than Astro Bot. I expect to start seeing this little guy everywhere going forward.
