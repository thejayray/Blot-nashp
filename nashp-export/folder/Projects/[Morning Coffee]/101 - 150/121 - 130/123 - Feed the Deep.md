###### Good morning. A short newsletter this week. Preparing for some changes. Expecting good news today. It was a busy weekend setting up our chicken coop and getting our chickens settled in. Another week of running and playing basketball. Currently watching [Industry](https://youtu.be/fV6BGl2YA04?si=cQClqWF2f-L9zmUV). On the Steam Deck, I’m playing [Feed the Deep](https://youtu.be/d8t69tpDuUw?si=BaUDmzIGJXKdTRDG) and [The Long Dark](https://youtu.be/PAKw7yokYFg?si=5ZXTxzmkN7VrJCJz). Looking forward to [Gamescom](https://youtu.be/8yVvxbFrCBA?si=oPabE2D4o_jiEE4B) this week. This is Morning Coffee 123. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

One of my favorite type of games are the ones created by a single person. The latest one I’ve been playing is [Feed the Deep](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2332260/Feed_the_Deep/) (before that was [Animal Well](https://youtu.be/QQvFdoNE-Y0?si=bwNbP1lUBo3uo8ir)). [Luke Muscat](https://lukemuscat.com/), the designer behind Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride, just delivered an atmospheric deep sea adventure where each cave is procedurally generated. As you explore these underwater caves, you have to manage your resources to survive, either from the creatures around every corner, or worst, not having enough oxygen to make it back up for air. What starts as a calming exploration can quickly become scary if you lose track of time or get lost.
