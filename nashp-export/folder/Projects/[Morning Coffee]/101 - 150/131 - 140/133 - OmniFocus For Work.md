###### Good morning. Finishing this letter up in the new office. Already a few coffees in thanks to the nearby cafeteria. The foggy cover photo above was taken this weekend, early in the morning, during a flag football game. Spent the rest of the weekend resting as much as possible. Was able to finish writing out Rose’s party invitation and send that out to family and friends (Thankfully the only time I’ve used Facebook in a year). Looking forward to enjoying Rose’s big day with her (She’s been talking about it for months). This is Morning Coffee 133. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## OmniFocus For Work

I’ve started using OmniFocus [again](https://nashp.com/35) for my new job. I was noticing the assignments that were issued to us take about fifty steps to complete. So instead of relying on memory to finish these tasks, I’ll be leaning on Sequential Projects inside of [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus). The vision for this is when a new ticket shows up in my inbox, I’ll use one of these templates to start checking off all the boxes until that assignment is complete.

The beauty of the sequential project is that every task in that project is hidden except for that very next action. Once that box is checked, only then does the next step appear. Using this setup will make my life much easier with new tickets.

I’m also utilizing the tagging system in OmniFocus. There’s often tasks that can’t be completed until someone else is involved. By using the tagging system, the next time I’m in a meeting with that person, I can press their name and it’ll show me everything that’s waiting for their attention, regardless of what project or area it’s in. 

I’m thankful that I’ve learned [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus), [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), and project management over the years, because it’s really paying off already with this new position.

## Trading Season

Listening to [Chromakopia](https://music.apple.com/us/album/chromakopia/1776500452) today. Watching [The Penguin](https://www.hbo.com/the-penguin) and the start of the NBA season (Spurs with Chris Paul and Wemby). Playing a lot of [Metaphor](https://metaphor.atlus.com/index.html?lang=en). Fascinated with JRPGs lately. Started adding all of the Dragon Quest games to the Steam Deck and [Game Boy](https://nashp.com/110) and planning to start playing through a few of those soon.

Preparing for another [trading season](https://nashp.com/97): turning a few gadgets I’m not using into one big one [again](https://nashp.com/97). Either the [Retroid Pocket Mini](https://www.goretroid.com/collections/frontpage/products/retroid-pocket-mini-handheld), [Retroid Pocket 5](https://www.goretroid.com/collections/frontpage/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld), or the [Odin 2 Mini](https://www.ayntec.com/products/odin2-mini). [Help me](mailto:nashp@me.com) decide which one out the three to get.
