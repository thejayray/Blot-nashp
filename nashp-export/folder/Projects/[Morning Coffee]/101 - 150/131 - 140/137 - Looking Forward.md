# Looking Forward

### [Morning Coffee 137: Nov. 27th, 2024][1]

![][image-1]

---- 

This will be my last email for the year. I’ll be taking the five weeks of December off to enjoy the holidays, and then returning in January, hopefully refreshed and rejuvenated. This is the first time I take a break from the newsletter since starting in [2022][2]. 137 weeks in a row later, I’m definitely excited for this little break. This break will give me time to do some deep thinking and regrouping, without having to worry about an output every week. I also have some [projects][3] that I’ll be working on. 

On the admin side, I’ll be spending some time organizing my Apple Notes and [Synology][4] drives. Notes, files, and folders. I also look forward to building out my [Sofa][5] lists, thinking through new ingredients, and beta testing the new podcast feature. On the gaming side, [Dragon Quest III][6] and [Metaphor][7] are the games I’ll be playing. I’ll also be spending time migrating all my emulation from a few devices to just the [Retroid Pocket 5][8].

Last but not least, I’m excited for the holidays. It’s my favorite time of the year. The quality time with family, the reflecting on the past and what’s ahead, the holiday decorations and meals, and then watching the kids open presents. It all adds up to special memories that I’m really looking forward to.

[Until next time.][9]
