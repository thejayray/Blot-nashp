Dear Rose,

You’re turning three today, and I wanted to write you a letter like I did [last year](https://nashp.com/83), simply to create a snapshot of how you’re processing the world at three. Just like I mentioned last year, time is moving way too fast, and as I try to balance the busyness of life, staying present with you is always at the top of my mind. I don’t want to miss a single moment of you growing up.

You started school recently, and I told you that I’d be sad now that you’re away from home, but you tried to comfort me by saying, “Don’t worry Dad, Mom will protect you.” These are the little sentences you bless me with throughout the week. Like when your brother got in the car recently, and right away, you asked him, “Isaac, how’s your day going?” And after he responded, you replied, “Well, mine is going great.”

I’m constantly fascinated by your mind and how much you’re learning already. You like dancing now, and putting puzzles together. You know all the days of the week, and you’re starting to learn time. Lately you’ve been randomly telling me you’d like a hug. Or as you’re falling asleep, you ask if I can rub your back.

Before each meal, you lead in prayer, even if you’re the only one at the table. It’s the same prayer each meal: “Dear Jesus, thank you for this food. Thank you for mommy and daddy, Isaac and Rose, and all the people. Keep us safe, in your name we pray. Amen.”

This is just a glimpse of my days with you, and there’s not enough words to describe how special all of this feels. 

Happy Birthday.
