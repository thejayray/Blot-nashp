### [Morning Coffee 132: October. 21st, 2024](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj)

---- 

###### Good morning. Busy weekend: home cooking (shrimp tacos, shrimp spaghetti), watched a flag football game, a pumpkin patch, and the house of blues in New Orleans (AC/DC). Another week at my new job. Learning the hallways. Getting across the facility much faster. Each day is a different set of jobs, depending on the tickets that land in my inbox. Thankful for the nights and weekends (and half-day Fridays). The perfect amount of time for family and basketball. Was also offered a skill trailer position again for a local basketball organization. Getting paid to play and teach basketball on the side is a cool thing to be able to do. This is Morning Coffee 132. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Preparing for the Party

Rose turns three in just a few weeks, and it’s time to start planning. A Peppa Pig party at a gymnasium with trampolines and bounce houses. Time to prepare the invitations, order a cake, decorations, and decide on a present. How is she three already?

## Switched to Visible

When I stopped working for AT&T I also lost all of those benefits. Perfect opportunity to finally switch to a different carrier. I went with [Visible](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1367950045). The process of porting out took me five minutes, thanks to their app. Was a very seamless experience. Visible uses Verizon’s towers, so I’m getting a very strong signal. Unlimited data and hotspot, all for $25 a month. I highly recommend Visible. So far so good.

## A Challenge Note

As I was going through older notes from the last few years, I stumbled on one titled “Current Challenges”. This note was me documenting whatever obstacles I was up against at that time. And as I went through each list, 99% of those challenges are no longer there. From the small ones to the big ones. All gone. I recommend you do the same. Take the time every few months and make a dated list of anything that’s bothering you. This small list is a simple way to steer your life in the direction you want to go. Identify. Document. Adjust.
