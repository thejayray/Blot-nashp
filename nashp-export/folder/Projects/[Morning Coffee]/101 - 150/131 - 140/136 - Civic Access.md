### [Morning Coffee 136: Nov. 18th, 2024][1]

---- 

###### Good evening. Just finished walking back from the office. Fried shrimp and fish for dinner. Watching Rose learn how to run around in [Astro Bot][2] (Simple things like going through a door to find her friends is impressive). Her birthday party was a success. Lots of people, food, and Peppa Pig presents. Important notice: Next week’s letter will be the last one for the year. If you have any request or questions, now’s the time to [ask them][3]. I’ll be wrapping things up in next week’s email. I’ll be taking the month of December off, and then returning January 6th. This is Morning Coffee 136. [Buy][4] me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope][5] this letter finds you well.

## CIVIC Access Pouch 2L

Since starting the new job, the one thing that leaves the house with me each day is the [Civic Access Pouch 2L][6]. CAP2 for short. All photos were pulled from [their][7] website.

The CAP2 holds everything I’ll be using that day, like my badge, keys, wedding ring, Field Notes, AirPods, and a dozen other little things. This pouch is easily the best pouch I’ve ever used. From the amount it holds, to the way it zips up into a cube to travel with, and then to the way it opens up with a slant and displays what’s inside of it. That slant is what sets it apart from the competition. When opened up at my desk, it looks as if it always belongs there, holding each time that needs to be accessed.

## Inside the Bag

Inside of the bag: for tech is my [AirPods Pro][8], the [Retroid Pocket Mini][9], charging cables and brick, SD card adapter, [SanDisk Portable SSD][10], and an [Apple AirTag][11]. For non-tech items, I have my wedding ring, hospital badge, work keys, [Field Notes][12], pens, highlighters, microfiber cleaning cloths, fingernail clippers, and alcohol wipes.

## Leash and Anchor

I recently modified the pouch so it can be worn like a sling when walking, and then allowing the strap to be removed and put in the top zipper when I arrive. This is thanks to Peak Design’s [Leash and Anchor][13] clips. Those Anchor clips make it so a the Leash strap can be removed instantly and stored away in the top zipper. A feature that this pouch wasn’t designed for, but is now one of my favorite perks to the CAP2.
