### [Morning Coffee 131: Oct. 14th, 2024](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj)

*This was written while serving coffee at the church, during our downtime. A list of topics were already waiting for me, thanks to [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) and the [Bullet Journaling System](https://youtu.be/xHGtMw-JFRU?si=tP3KLyXqCKkPgG61) I’ve used all week. Date, space, bullet points. Repeat.*

The journey starts with a quiet walk to the hospital. Fifteen minutes of solitude to gather my thoughts and prepare for this [new chapter](https://nashp.com/130). This is much different than my previous work-from-home job, where I was isolated from the world and stationary as I answered calls.

At the hospital, I’m given an office that’s completely empty, along with a key to a big storage room with lots of furniture to choose from. I selected a desk, a television on the wall, two tables, and an office chair. I also brought a few things from home to personalize the office. A white [HomePod](https://www.apple.com/homepod-mini/), a white desk fan, a plant, and a few books.

With this new position, a lot of my day revolves around meetings and being at certain rooms of the hospital at specific times of the day, so one of the first things I did was connect my new Microsoft Exchange account to my phone. Now my calendar events for work show up on my wrist with the [Fantastical](https://apps.apple.com/app/id718043190) widget.

While going down the elevator, my [Watch](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-ultra-2/) buzzes, and it’s a notification from Rose’s new preschool. I get about ten of these updates a day from her school now. “She just had her morning snack. She went potty. She just started her nap. She was happy. ” These little notification are helpful because I can keep working with the peace of mind that she’s ok. 

When returning home each day, my Watch averages about 15,000 steps. That’s before any exercises. And now that I’m home before five during the week, I can hunt down the basketball gym that everyone’s playing at. I expect to consistently be in great basketball shape now, thanks to this new schedule (and salad bar in the hospital cafeteria).

At night (and some [Remote Play](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1436192460) throughout the day), I’ve been making progress in [Metaphor](https://youtu.be/STMwGWyrfC8?si=bjE0SLOHdiGSVZCB), a fantasy JRPG that’s like nothing I’ve ever played before. It’s currently my game of the year.
