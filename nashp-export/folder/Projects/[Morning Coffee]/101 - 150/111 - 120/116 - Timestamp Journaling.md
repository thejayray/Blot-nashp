###### Good morning. Welcome to the [house of balloons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_XW_CIwbB8&list=PLtyN1XIs_HjdmDU6Vldc0HthCm6zZp1b4). I currently have 50 balloons floating around the house that we to took from a baby shower, and I invited all the kids over from the party to come play with Rose. Busy weekend. A lot of driving and quality time with the family. Wish I could slow down time to enjoy these moments more. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Timestamp Journaling

I’ve been using [Apple Journal](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/12/apple-launches-journal-app-a-new-app-for-reflecting-on-everyday-moments/) for most of my writing lately. The beauty of this app is that there’s no files or folders to manage, just your notes to endlessly scroll through. This allows me to progressively think through ideas  over time without worrying about anything other than what’s on my mind that day.

For my journal entries, I’ve built a system with timestamps and summaries: I add the current time before writing the idea, and when the day ends, I use those timestamps to write a recap. A simple but effective way to capture thoughts.
