###### Good evening. Sitting in the living room on bean bags with Rose, watching Frozen II. Fresh [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/) coffee is brewed. We spent the day out of town. First feeding ducks, then eating lunch. A nice peaceful day. Been playing [Star Ocean](https://youtu.be/3JaYQDytelE?si=kFPnDSsPdNn5faWG): The Second Story R, [Once Human](https://youtu.be/CZO5Yln07kg?si=Xv-JS1PBSFsY8C-h), and [Concord](https://youtu.be/qNW71AQlzK8?si=XOK-ZbLYtgIEz5XV). Been listening to [The Death of Slim Shady](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN1mxegxWPd0GfRvWy_WzwpNKnqSWTV5U&si=Ol9M4ND4QtWw7E2D). It’s a dark story about cancel culture and saying goodbye in the most Eminem way possible: vulgar attacks on current events through overcomplicated rhyme patterns. It’s very polarizing, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Won’t be for everyone though. This is Morning Coffee 118. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Hide Your Apps

There were many features introduced at [WWDC](https://youtu.be/LtIWE4CCX5M?si=4cCfDq7T8qaYwhlA) for iOS 18 (the [public beta](https://beta.apple.com) should be out this week), but my favorite and most used feature is the ability to hide apps. If there’s one thing I love, it’s a tidy space. This features allows that.

Holding down on any third party app gives you the option to hide it behind FaceID. Do this to clean up the apps visible on your phone, and only display the ones you use most often. Here’s a life hack for you: Hide the social media ones.

Once the apps are hidden, they won’t show up anywhere on the phone (not in widgets, not in search, not in App Library), just the hidden folder. I now have 40 hidden apps tucked away.
