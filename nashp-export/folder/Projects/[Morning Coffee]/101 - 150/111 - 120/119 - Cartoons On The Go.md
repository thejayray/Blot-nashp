###### Good morning. Pralines and Cream coffee beans with the Hario V60. Prepping for the week. Todo list with Olivia. Big season of changes on the way. You’ll also notice the newsletter is a little tidier. Been playing The Witcher 3 and Moonstone Island. This is Morning Coffee 119. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Cartoons On The Go

This is a story about the little Gameboy that isn’t setup to play games. It’s been [six months](https://nashp.com/94) since I gave Rose her own “[Gameboy](https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-2s-handheld-retro-gaming-system)”, and I’m fascinated with how well it’s been working for her.

At two years old (almost three!), I can hand her the Gameboy knowing that she doesn’t need help getting started. As soon as she presses the power button, dozens of videos are waiting for her, even without an internet connection.

The [Retroid Pocket 2S](https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-2s-handheld-retro-gaming-system) is the name of this device, and there’s only two apps needed to make this cartoon process work: [YouTube Kids](https://www.youtubekids.com/) and [AnyHome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.draco.anyhome&hl=en_US).

- [YouTube Kids](https://www.youtubekids.com/) continues to learn the type of videos she likes (and doesn’t like), while downloading recommended ones in the background when back online.

- [AnyHome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.draco.anyhome&hl=en_US)’s only job is to treat the app of your choice as the home screen, basically locking the Gameboy into a single app. This allows her videos to show up right when pressing the wake button.

If you have kids, I highly recommend this setup. It’s cheaper and much cooler than any phone or a tablet you can give them.
