###### Good Morning. Currently drinking a [Red Bull Infusion](https://www.pjscoffee.com/energy/) (Blue Coconut Blast) from PJ’s Coffee while Rose takes a nap in the backseat. A quick car ride always does the trick. While she’s sleeping, I’m hoping to write this week’s newsletter. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## The Plans

A five-hour drive to Destin. A five-day vacation. Two days on the beach. Double red flags for most of the week, meaning the water was closed to the public. A day at the [Big Kahuna's Waterpark](https://www.bigkahunas.com), where I spent most of my time there floating around the Lazy River. A professional family photoshoot on the beach. A condo swimming pool. Running a few miles through the town. A dolphin show at the [Gulfarium](https://gulfarium.com/). A five-hour drive back home.

## The Food

Have fun during the day, and then have nice meals at night, seemed to be the theme for most our week. Snow Crabs at [Brutula’s](https://www.brotulas.com/), Shrimp & Grits at [Fudpucker’s](https://www.fudpucker.com/), Baja Steak Tacos at [Borrito del Sol](https://www.burritodelsol.com/), and my favorite during the trip, Spicy Chicken Udon Noodle Bowl at [Yuga’s Sushi & Sake House](https://yugasushihouse.com/). On the way home, I stopped by the smallest coffee shop ever called [Alaska Bean Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/alaskabeancoffeeco/) and tried their Iced Grizzly Latte. It was around this time, after reflecting on all the meals we tried throughout our vacation, that I started wondering if I should just pivot my writing career and become a food reviewer.

## The Watch

Even though we were on vacation, I was able to squeeze in a few live events around our plans. 

There were three of them: 

- The Celtics [won](https://www.theringer.com/2024/6/18/24181405/boston-celtics-are-the-2024-nba-champions) the NBA Finals.

- Nintendo had their [Nintendo Direct](https://www.youtube.com/live/kX3BkD5PVUM?si=VWk8kFJttbWSXUov), where Zelda’s [Echoes of Wisdom](https://youtu.be/94RTrH2erPE?si=T5HaHbUVNxDwauXj) was announced.

- Kendrick Lamar streamed his Juneteenth concert on Amazon Prime Video, titled [The Pop Out: Ken & Friends](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+pop+out).
