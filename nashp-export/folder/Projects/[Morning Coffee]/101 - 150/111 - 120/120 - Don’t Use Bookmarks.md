###### Good morning. Writing you after a busy weekend and the start of a new work schedule. Bracing myself for all the upcoming changes at work. I’ve been watching [Hacks](https://youtu.be/q6ke-bfXSBg?si=0tzTya5-h0ipw3VG), [House of the Dragon](https://youtu.be/YN2H_sKcmGw?si=C6VfkLHIVgq9WSin), and [Books of Doom](https://youtu.be/R5brjBgjrLA?si=sJlYrUDPvg0DYcDR). Been playing [Diablo IV](https://youtu.be/7RdDpqCmjb4?si=6--TcE6Yld9QO5Aj) and [Fallout London](https://youtu.be/rahBCfRdVac?si=RTTxLclHsF50T6jU). Let me [know](mailto:nashp@me.com) what you’ve been watching, reading, playing, or listening to. Always interested in growing my library. This is Morning Coffee, **120** weeks in a row. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe4jqd135LRc4U4gj) me a coffee to keep it going. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Don’t Use Bookmarks

I was recently asked about how I manage bookmarks. My answer was simple: I don’t. My only bookmarks are the four that I visit throughout the week (my site, my newsletter, check-in at church for the kids, and my work schedule). I don’t believe bookmarks are very useful. It’s a place that can easily get filled up with outdated links.

Instead of using bookmarks, I make decisions on each link that I might need later. If it’s something actionable (to purchase or write about), I send it to [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) (you might use Reminders), knowing that I’ll be checking off that task soon. If it’s something I plan on reading later, I send it to Safari’s Reading List.

If it’s something I want to reference in the future, I add it to Apple Journal with a quick note about why it’s important. I’ll find it again by searching for one of the words in that quick note.

If it’s a Youtube video, I add it to YouTube’s Watch Later feature. Not as a list to complete, but just a filter to get back to interesting videos.

For each day’s headlines, I use Reeder, an [upcoming](https://gloria.social/@rizzi/111856959119832404) app from Silvio Rizzi. I scroll through the latest feeds and send the ones that I want to find again into the “Later” bucket. This gives me a filtered list of all the links I found interesting.

[Mela](https://mela.recipes/) is another app from Silvio Rizzi, that my wife Olivia uses throughout the week, for recipes. Find a recipe, add it to Mela, uncheck the groceries you already have, and then add the rest to your Apple Reminder’s Grocery List. When it’s time to cook, press “Cook” and get simple step-by-step instructions.
