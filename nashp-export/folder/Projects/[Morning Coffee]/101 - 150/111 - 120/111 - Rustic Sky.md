###### Good morning. We’re on the interstate, on our way back home from a three day camping trip as a family. I switched to the passenger seat after we ate lunch, so I can write you this letter. I turned thirty eight a few days ago, and that has me reflecting on life in many ways. Meeting my wife four years ago, buying a home and having a daughter soon after, and now being able to work from home with them right there with me. A full circle. I start a new position at my job next week, and we also have some vacations coming up. So many things to be thankful for. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## How to Pack

*Last year, on Newsletter 64, I wrote [How to Pack](https://nashp.com/64). This can be considered Part Two. This letter will just be a simple breakdown of how I packed for the trip. I’m a collector of bags and pouches, and I believe that’s the key to packing efficiently. Being able to bring just the right amount is always a fun challenge. This time around, I was intentional about leaving behind more than usual. Here’s a list of everything.*

---- 

For a weekend trip, I packed very light. One bag. The [Goruck GR1 21L](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1). Inside of this bag was three pouches, a classic green [Stanley Thermos](https://www.stanley1913.com/products/classic-legendary-bottle-1-0-qt), and a [book](https://a.co/d/bYxz6xD).

1. For my clothes, everything was inside of the [Evergoods Transit Packing Cube (8L)](https://evergoods.us/products/transit-packing-cube-8l). Shirts and shorts on one side. Boxers and socks on the other.

2. For toiletry, I used the [Gravel Explorer Mini](https://www.graveltravel.com/products/explorer-mini?variant=39641961070727&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&tw_source=google&tw_adid=&tw_campaign=16834482122&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3tCyBhDBARIsAEY0XNnKSs5dXQbiUyyRJjcP-jOV1rtDJBKAhNT44fgLU-sqFDqE8ZFCbwEaAt96EALw_wcB). Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, cologne, and [Gravel’s travel bottle](https://www.graveltravel.com/products/3oz-liquid-bottles-two-pack).

3. For my other gear, I used the discontinued [Alpaka Pencil Case Pro](https://alpakagear.com). [Gameboy](https://nashp.com/110), AirPods, phone charger, wallet, [Field Notes: Expedition](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/expedition?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3tCyBhDBARIsAEY0XNn8QNI79y_9QITfmHTLeg2hGgitt8jy6iq3GR64EcaI-uNfwgcgtdQaAoQ4EALw_wcB), and [Bellroy Micro pen](https://bellroy.com/products/micro-pen).
