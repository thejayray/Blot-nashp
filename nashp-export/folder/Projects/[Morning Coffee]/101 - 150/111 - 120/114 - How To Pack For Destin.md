###### Good morning. By the time you read this I’ll already be on the interstate. If I had to predict the future it would look like this: Finish writing this intro, run treadmill, watch House of the Dragon, sleep, wake up and start driving to Florida, stop at the first [Cracker Barrel](https://www.crackerbarrel.com/). As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

# How to Pack

### This is Part 3 in my How To Pack series ([Part 1: Alabama](https://nashp.com/64), [Part 2: Rustic Sky](https://nashp.com/111)).

## Backpack and Duffle

The two bags that were used to pack for this trip are The [GoRuck GR1 21L](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr1) and the [GoRuck Kit Bag](https://www.goruck.com/products/kit-bag-waxed-canvas). Each bag has four main items inside of it (with many other items inside of those). Pouches, bags, and cubes. That’s the secret to packing efficiently. The amount of items that I’m able to seamlessly fit into these pouches makes traveling a breeze.
