###### Good morning. Currently sitting on the couch next to the slide and tunnel, working on the MacBook, finishing up the newsletter. Rose went grab [her computer](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53687411674_e277c2d2af_k.jpg) to work with me. This week I introduced her to the concept of an obstacle course: Through the door, in the tent, through the tunnel, on the stool, jump to the bean bag, up the slide, down the slide, and land on the other bean bag. What I’m watching/playing: [Cave Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHx0I_vWIic&list=PL3613453236C239AA). [Fallout TV Series](https://youtu.be/V-mugKDQDlg?si=nehKZmCtiCkslFir), Backlog [one](https://youtu.be/_TOSjeql1Jw?si=K1vDDXklDmknRvEC) and [two](https://youtu.be/aNtgKC4LHFU?si=qWeHQW17aaTAt0OR). As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Daily Log

I’ve been experimenting with an [outliner](https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/) to [rapid log](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq/what-is-rapid-logging-understand-rapid-logging-bullets-and-signifiers) throughout the day. What makes this process useful is that any thought can go down its own rabbit hole with indenting and focus mode, hiding other bullet points while focusing on a current idea. A quick way to brainstorm on the fly.

## VR-Lite

This will be a very niche section, and most people won’t have what’s needed to even try this, but it’s interesting enough to discuss. Thanks to the [XR Gaming Plugin](https://github.com/wheaney/decky-XRGaming), I now have virtual reality with my Steam Deck, with games that aren’t even meant to be virtual reality. Basically what this plugin is doing is converting the input of the right joystick to the head-tracking movement of the glasses. Meaning I can tilt my head up and look at the top of a building. Here’s a [video](https://youtu.be/FespQ5peme4?si=X7zPBUOr2IqHS-5l&t=1447) where the developer introduces you to the plugin.

Requirements:

- [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck)
- [XReal Air Glasses](https://www.xreal.com/air/)
- [XR Gaming Plugin](https://github.com/wheaney/decky-XRGaming)
