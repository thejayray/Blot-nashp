###### Good morning. Writing you from my office. I’m typing on the MacBook, my dad’s editing his next [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CajunKayak) video next to me, and Rose is sitting on the bean bag behind us, watching Cocomelon. We’re about to start frying fish for lunch. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## A Bear That Blogs

If you’re looking for a simple way to blog, I recently stumbled on a new platform that seems very easy to use. It’s called [Bear](https://bearblog.dev). “A privacy-first, no-nonsense, super-fast blogging platform. No trackers, no javascript, no stylesheets. Just your words. This is a blogging platform where words matter most.”

I still use [Blot](https://blot.im), but if I was just starting out today, and didn’t have the custom theme that I’ve been building for a decade now, then I’d probably be using something like [Bear](https://bearblog.dev).

## Gameboy Micro

The [RG28XX](https://anbernic.com/products/rg28xx) (I’ll be calling it the Gameboy Micro) is exactly what I was looking for in a handheld device. It’s smaller than both the iPhone and [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/expedition?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6auyBhDzARIsALIo6v-xslpvnCfWJJlZuyxePZcspnUTGvyq4ytZI1oVOLjRWxHs79mbx4waAvCVEALw_wcB), at 2.83-inches, making it very pocketable. It’s tiny (fits in the palm of your hands), [runs](https://www.youtube.com/live/EXUJmUhMcR8?si=jp4Ymya4yLrzhbpw) [MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI) (a must have custom OS for retro handhelds), plays landscape instead of vertical, and run every console from the original Nintendo to first PlayStation. This is replacing the [Miyoo Mini Plus](https://officialmiyoomini.com) for me, leaving my gaming devices as [RG28XX](https://anbernic.com/products/rg28xx), [Steam Deck OLED](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/oled), and the [PlayStation 5](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/).

## Screentime

[PPSSPP](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6496972903) landed on the iPhone this week. I had a PSP in 2005, right before leaving for the Air Force. I brought that with me through Basic Training and Tech School, until ultimately trading it in for the Xbox 360, when that was released. Now I have those games on my iPhone with [PPSSPP](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6496972903). [Retroarch](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6499539433) was released this week as well, but it’s much more complicated to use. I recommend sticking to [Delta](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1048524688) and PPSSPP for now.

I spent most gaming time this week playing [Starfield](https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield). The process of getting my save [from](https://github.com/Z1ni/XGP-save-extractor) Xbox to Steam could be an entire newsletter on its own. I’ve been playing on the Steam Deck with a few mods that improve quality of life (along with the big new update that was just released).

[Dune: Prophecy](https://youtube.com/watch?v=EEoQAoEGLhw&si=ub1Uaw9adlFTF24A), [Undisputed](https://youtu.be/PyKMZjEfFms?si=mGh2luvCsOt5QZRY) and [College Football 25](https://youtu.be/W1QDaXkufCo?si=Mpa6tTJLTHpLvK5t) were three trailers that were worth checking out this week.

## Previously

Last week I wrote about [Kendrick v Drake](https://nashp.com/109). A week before that, I showed off my homemade [arcade](https://nashp.com/108) setup. [Delta](https://nashp.com/106) released a month ago. Still one of the coolest apps on my phone.
