###### Good morning. Currently sitting at the coffee shop with Rose: eggs, bacon, beignets, and coffee. Putting the finishing touches on the newsletter. This one’s much different than the usual topics. It’ll either be interesting to you, or completely pointless. Hip-Hop, and especially petty rap battling, won’t be for everyone. I followed every moment of it so you don’t have to. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.om) this letter finds you well.

## Preface

A few weeks ago, a battle started between two of the biggest names in the music industry. Drake and Kendrick Lamar. Normally something like this drags out a lot longer than it did, but both artists were trading blows within days, and sometimes minutes.

It was fascinating to watch (or pointless if you’re not interested), and even though I have a bias towards Kendrick Lamar, I hope this delivers a comprehensive breakdown of the last few weeks.

## Part One

- [First Person Shooter](https://youtu.be/Xty2gi5cMa8?si=J8FT5ySeuyTxNOqc): 11.15.23
- [Like That](https://youtu.be/N9bKBAA22Go?si=BeZ5vBd6_gSGiTR1): 03.31.24

The two big songs that created all of this. [First Person Shooter](https://youtu.be/Xty2gi5cMa8?si=J8FT5ySeuyTxNOqc) is Drake and J. Cole basically saying they’re the two best out right now. We hadn’t heard from Kendrick in over a year, until he surprised us with the feature on [Like That](https://youtu.be/N9bKBAA22Go?si=BeZ5vBd6_gSGiTR1), which is a direct shot at Drake and J. Cole for the [First Person Shooter](https://youtu.be/Xty2gi5cMa8?si=J8FT5ySeuyTxNOqc) song.

## Part Two

- [7 Minute Drill](https://youtu.be/F18RQuT3-c0?si=qf6sI0lCPm3u0GEl): 04.05.24
- [J. Cole’s Apology](https://youtu.be/L9MTWBvv8Tg?si=xstNFY-yUm2a86ms): 04.07.24
- [Push Ups](https://youtu.be/HKH9p19PRLA?si=rAW5obyze5mtqmri): 04.19.24
- [Taylor Made Freestyle](https://youtu.be/zhEiduBxX4c?si=F11DpZZCIqE3VNvC): 04.19.24 (later that night)

I batched these together because they’re the initial reactions to the [Like That](https://youtu.be/N9bKBAA22Go?si=BeZ5vBd6_gSGiTR1) song. J. Cole responds, then regrets responding, and then Drake arrives with two songs, egging Kendrick on to respond.

## Part Three

- [Euphoria](https://youtu.be/NPqDIwWMtxg?si=LTz7x31MZbmkN1q8): 04.30.24
- [6.16 in LA](https://youtu.be/R1ypnmTMNqA?si=_0vvMQ223iu9OvAX): 05.03.24 (at 6:16 PT)
- [Family Matters](https://youtu.be/ZkXG3ZrXlbc?si=9eJVK99uTybFsJOg): 05.03.24 (at 11pm EST)
- [Meet the Grahams](https://youtu.be/2QiFl9Dc7D0?si=y34mq4Rn9WiqAEC_): 05.03.24 (37 minutes later)

On Tuesday morning, Kendrick started the next chapter to all of this with [Euphoria](https://youtu.be/NPqDIwWMtxg?si=LTz7x31MZbmkN1q8), and then [6.16 in LA](https://youtu.be/R1ypnmTMNqA?si=_0vvMQ223iu9OvAX) a few days later (Friday morning). Drake followed up that night with [Family Matters](https://youtu.be/ZkXG3ZrXlbc?si=9eJVK99uTybFsJOg), but Kendrick instantly responded within minutes with [Meet the Grahams](https://youtu.be/2QiFl9Dc7D0?si=y34mq4Rn9WiqAEC_). Where [Family Matters](https://youtu.be/ZkXG3ZrXlbc?si=9eJVK99uTybFsJOg) was uptempo, [Meet the Grahams](https://youtu.be/2QiFl9Dc7D0?si=y34mq4Rn9WiqAEC_) was slow and eerie, on an Alchemist beat that sounded like something from a horror movie.

## Part Four

- [Not Like Us](https://youtu.be/T6eK-2OQtew?si=VR-CeeJQJxTppRuw): 05.04.24
- [The Heart Part 6](https://youtu.be/HJeY-FXidDQ?si=b2PXRVuyXKEydBdx): 05.05.24

The following day, Kendrick returned again with a completely different type of song. [Not Like Us](https://youtu.be/T6eK-2OQtew?si=VR-CeeJQJxTppRuw) was the nail in the coffin in a lot of ways. The biggest reason is it’s currently the number one song in the world right now. It’s not every day that a diss record is also a hit record.

Drake followed up the next day with [The Heart Part 6](https://youtu.be/HJeY-FXidDQ?si=b2PXRVuyXKEydBdx) that sounded like the end to this saga. He mentions that he’s done responding, and at times (in my opinion) even sounds exhausted.

## Commentary

- [Rap Life Review](https://youtu.be/x0E8as1mcpo?si=cxhlSffD-APyszw8)
- [Joe Budden Podcast](https://youtu.be/ZHpNtDgs9z0?si=eJLUR9ReEyy2NuD8)

These are two great discussions and breakdowns on everything that transpired. Rap Life gives a more calm discussion, where the Joe Budden Podcast was full of energy, yelling, and dancing.

## Reactions

- [Like That](https://youtu.be/zelM5HuZNvk?si=wOjykCTc3D74tsXb)
- [Push Ups](https://youtu.be/pmTcwP9vZg4?si=zWIX0AVTy-PjXurj)
- [Taylor Made Freestyle](https://youtu.be/ePtdmvZa_tU?si=noLoVmoburAzUGgp)
- [Euphoria](https://youtu.be/ECcunHLAf-k?si=YDOF7p0Qy-MlCBAB)
- [Family Matters](https://youtu.be/bBySlfywork?si=meh3JUEMzha2C2se)
- [Meet the Grahams](https://youtu.be/ZuhjP8YbScE?si=TB5HPbz1TS_4wFtg)
- [Not Like Us](https://youtu.be/YghDpAEECs8?si=iJ67X-IGfH7_ojxu)
- [The Heart Part 6](https://youtu.be/Eh3CI0Ywdw8?si=kscXBcn5rVTAkjZ5)

When there’s a song that I really like, I usually also watch reactions of people’s first impressions. Someone was smart enough to make compilations of these reactions.

## Conclusion

Battle rapping is something I’ve always enjoyed. It’s a [sport](https://youtu.be/u1-z2hxXxKg?si=XULtKIOzMD18Kdcu). I wish this Kendrick v Drake battle would’ve been more about the music and less of a soap opera, but I think in 2024, this will always be the way it turns out. The internet feeds on this kind of gossip. Regardless though, it was entertaining.

I hope today’s newsletter gives you a simple but comprehensive breakdown of the situation. Feel free to [share your thoughts](mailto:nashp@me.com) with me about all of this.
