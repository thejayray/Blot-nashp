###### Good morning. Writing you from [CR Coffee Shop](https://www.crcoffeenola.com/) in New Orleans. Headed to celebrate our [two-year anniversary](https://youtu.be/pWxk3XCzQbo?si=iOvcQkbj7SX83bVO). Thankful for all of our little moments together as a family. It keeps getting better by the day. Also reflecting on all the creating I’ve been doing lately. Last week was [100](https://nashp.com/100) newsletters, a few weeks ago, I released [two](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQQG3JCF?binding=paperback&ref=dbs_dp_awt_sb_pc_tpbk) books, been [live-streaming](https://nashp.com/gg), and today, I’m announcing new videos that I’ll be working on each week. Also been recording a lot of new [music](https://nashp.com/music) lately for a new album (Having to retrain myself on the whole process of making music again). I mention this today because I often think back at how creative I “used to be” (as if I’m not creative now). This is a reminder to myself that even with my beautiful family, I’m still as creative as ever. It just looks different now. And I wouldn’t change it for the world. Happy anniversary, Olivia. And for everyone else, as always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## A Weekly Video

A complimentary video. Here’s the start of a new project: making a video each week that compliments Morning Coffee. The video will share similar ideas to the newsletter: what I’m working on, movies I’m watching, games I’m playing, and what I’ve been up to. All inside of one little video. [Here’s the first one.](https://youtu.be/LLbhuYHSSao?si=AMgYbhx-UvACl-iW)

## The Auxiliary Exchange

These have been a blast to make. It’s like a chess match, thinking of a song that compliments the one before it, but also gives the upcoming song a chance to be successful.
