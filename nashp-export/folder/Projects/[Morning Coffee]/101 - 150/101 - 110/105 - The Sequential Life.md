###### Good morning. Sitting in the car writing while Rose naps and Olivia skateboards. Fried fish for dinner (Here’s a [video](https://youtu.be/erXWSMM9rH0?si=_MIu3SL0YIRyQfWk) of my dad catching them). The last two days I ran four miles each, doubling what I usually run (Over the bridge. Through the town. Through the tunnel. Through the neighborhood. To the coffee shop). [The Box](https://www.twitch.tv/nashpdotcom): Playing [Balatro](https://youtu.be/VUyP21iQ_-g?si=n0VA12nzIDVpdTkz), [Alan Wake 2](https://youtu.be/MEWgOlTIW4Y?si=Yjf8189pdzZ8Pjvb) and [Final Fantasy VII](https://youtu.be/eHdaWMP7D2s?si=z7owUXcrtj14mrUE). Started watching [Fallout](https://youtu.be/V-mugKDQDlg?si=_Q-YrFsEEm6bViPN) on Prime Video. As always, I [hope](mailto:nashp@me.com) this letter finds you well.

## Emulating Stories

I spent a lot of time last week organizing ROMs. It’s a task that doesn’t require a lot of thought, and it’s easy to tinker with while doing my real job. In [MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI) on the [Miyoo Mini Plus](https://miyoominiv2.com/), I organized folders and collections, and simplified the look of each console (see the photo above). On the Steam Deck, I spent time organizing [Emulation Station](https://emulationstation.org/). On both the Steam Deck and the MacBook, I installed [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) (similar to Dropbox), allowing me to transfer over folders full of ROMs (PSX and Switch ROMs).

## The Sequential Life

A combination of [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) and the [Zeigarnik Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect) lead me to reimplement [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) into my workflow. I’ll be using it mostly for games and shows, simply because of the sequential projects feature. With sequential projects, even though there’s thirty task inside of a project, only the next action is shown. I can’t see episode five until episode four is complete, so the only task shown is episode four. I wish [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) would have this simple feature, but until then, [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) will get the job done.
