## Subscription Tracker

I started looking for a subscription tracker last week. I stumbled on [Bobby][12]. It’s simple, straight to the point, and gives me a quick overview of what I’m subscribed to. If you have a few things you want to keep track of, this is the best way to track it.

## Remote Play

The [Backbone][13] is where I spend most of my time gaming. With Fiber at home, and the PS5 plugged directly into Ethernet, I game on the go with the PlayStation more than I do at home.

I’m constantly amazed at how good this setup runs. To stream my PS5 on the go, and play it on my phone connected to the Backbone, is one of the most futuristic things I do on a daily basis.

## BibleProject

[BibleProject][14] has been a fascinating experience for me. I’m enjoying the way they breakdown sections of the Bible by illustrating and explaining big topics.

It fits how my brain processes information, and it’s easily the best way I’ve found to study the Bible. Highly recommend watching their videos.

### This is Morning Coffee: a weekly newsletter that arrives in your inbox every Monday morning. I write about productivity, technology, and cool things I find on the internet. My wife wants this to be my only job, so [pay][16] what you want, purchase my books on [Amazon][17], or join my [Music Program][18].
