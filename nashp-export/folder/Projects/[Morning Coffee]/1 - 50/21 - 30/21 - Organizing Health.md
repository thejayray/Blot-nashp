###### Just finished a 30 minute run to the coffee shop. Now I’ll spend the next hour writing about how I track all things health. Our phones and watches make it so easy to manage this information. Let’s begin.

## Health Tracking

I only have two pages of apps on my phone, and one of those pages is completely dedicated to health.

Apps on health screen:

- [NapBot](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1476436116)
- [FITINDEX](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1327763738)
- [Apple Health](https://www.apple.com/ios/health/)
- [Apple Fitness](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwi8tLGX8_35AhWg5uMHHQ9UA8UYABAAGgJ5bQ&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESauD2UqMqUIM8sNk1Vq870hPoJ5C39vbHWt3Lkp-oirUbaeyK8JKF2rlU3gW_0MxGlIIy9-9-wYQ3YEhokVLg3lZG0VRof42P569Z-10VIq1ScUzA3uTn6Q8sf8jDf4JHuv599Neo8hL-oPw&sig=AOD64_21Uu6FDTdv7eLUKcxqsswnW6eUlw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjSuqiX8_35AhVYczABHRQQDoUQ0Qx6BAgDEAE)

## All the Apps

By wearing my Watch as I sleep, [NapBot](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1476436116) tracks the amount of time I’ve been in bed, as well as my heart rate, respiratory rate, and deep sleep. 

When I wake up, I open [FITINDEX](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1327763738) and then stand on the scale. It’s become a daily habit. Doing this logs more than just my weight. It also tracks my BMI, muscle mass, body fat, etc. 

[Apple Health](https://www.apple.com/ios/health/) is the health app built into the phone, that acts as the hub for all things that get logged from each app. [Apple Fitness](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwi8tLGX8_35AhWg5uMHHQ9UA8UYABAAGgJ5bQ&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESauD2UqMqUIM8sNk1Vq870hPoJ5C39vbHWt3Lkp-oirUbaeyK8JKF2rlU3gW_0MxGlIIy9-9-wYQ3YEhokVLg3lZG0VRof42P569Z-10VIq1ScUzA3uTn6Q8sf8jDf4JHuv599Neo8hL-oPw&sig=AOD64_21Uu6FDTdv7eLUKcxqsswnW6eUlw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjSuqiX8_35AhVYczABHRQQDoUQ0Qx6BAgDEAE) is the home for exercising. It shows my rings that I aim to fill each day, it shows workouts I can watch and follow along, and it shows the rings of friends so I can follow their progress as well.

[Lifesum](https://apps.apple.com/app/id286906691) is where I log the food I eat. It calculates all the details in a very easy way. It also subtracts the amount of calories I’ve burned, leaving me with a balance of calories left for the day.

[Happy Scale](https://apps.apple.com/app/id532430574) is a minimal weight tracker that I use to get my average weight. [Fitness Totals](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1493350670) is a minimal activity tracker that I use for its widget. [Center](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1332483673) is a minimal meditation app.
