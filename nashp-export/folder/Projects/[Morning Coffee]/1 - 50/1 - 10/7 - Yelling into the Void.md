## Yelling into the Void (Monday Manifesto)

What are we chasing? Who are we trying to impress? Who are we mad at today? Static.

##### MEME. BEACH. COFFEE. DEATH. DANCE.

When the news of another shooting is right next to a TikTok dance, it’s no wonder we’ve become numb. It’s all entertainment. Yelling into the void. None of this matters. 

##### MEME. BEACH. COFFEE. DEATH. DANCE.

You think people understand you. But it’s just an algorithm. It’s designed to agree with you. None of this matters. Static.

## Slow week

This has been a slower week for creating than the previous few. I didn’t get to take as many photos. It’s important for me to acknowledge this and do better this coming week. I have to keep building the [portfolio](photos).

## File Management

Another week of cleaning up my files. Mostly in Ulysses. I have a new system that I started using that’ll shrink the number of notes I have by A LOT.

Instead of having hundreds of separate notes, I should have just a few. A folder that has specific topics, and a folder that has specific years. It’ll look something like this:

JOURNAL

- 2022
- 2021
- 2020

TOPICS

- Apple Glasses
- Minimalism
- Society

Random notes that I have throughout the year, goes in that specific year. Notes that I have on a certain topic, goes in the specific titled note. I split these new entries up with a line break, date, and then the note. Newest on top.

What I explained here took up most of my time this week. It’s a slow and tedious process to recreate thousands of notes to look like this.

## Three Audible credits

The struggle of having three Audible credits that expire in a few days. The pressure of not picking the right three audiobooks. I’ve gotten a few recommendations, but I haven’t pulled the trigger on the final three yet.

## MusicBox

> [MusicBox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicbox-save-music-for-later/id1614730313) is a flexible listen later app for Apple Music and Spotify. Keep track of new music, catalog and organize favorite albums and songs, assign tags, notes, metadata, and more.

I just started adding all my favorite albums to this app. Loving the widget the most. It gives me a layout of a bunch of random album covers that, if I click, brings me to that album to start playing. 

[MusicBox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicbox-save-music-for-later/id1614730313) is a nice way to build a collection of my favorite music. I can also build sections with different tags and smart searches, like favorite albums of 2022, of all-time, etc.

## Television

I just finished [The Dropout](https://www.hulu.com/series/the-dropout-13988f84-f1c8-40dd-a73c-4e71ab4bbe63 "Watch The Dropout Streaming Online | Hulu (Free Trial)https://www.hulu.com › series › the-dropout-13988f84-...") and [Atlanta: Season 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4288182/), also just started [Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://disneyplusoriginals.disney.com/show/obi-wan-kenobi) and [Stranger Things: Season 4](https://www.netflix.com/title/80057281). With so many shows to watch, it’s a great time for TV.
