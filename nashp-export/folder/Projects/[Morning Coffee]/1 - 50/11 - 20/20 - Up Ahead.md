###### Just leaving the coffee shop. The topics today will cover two different apps. One that I’m beta testing, and one that tracks my game progress. Simple nerdy week. Thanks for reading.

## Up Ahead

[Up Ahead](https://upaheadapp.com/) isn’t out yet. I’m beta testing it for the developer, but it’s already becoming one of my favorite apps on the iPhone. It’s a simple countdown app that lets me know how many days until something I’m looking forward to arrives. I’m only using it for consumption, stuff like TV shows and video games, but that frees up my calendar to only display important things. It has one job, and it does it incredibly well.

## Tracking Game Progress

Whether you’re using Apple Notes, Things, or Craft (the three I’ve used with this workflow), here’s a four step process to track your game progress: 

- Google game walkthrough
- Copy chapters
- Paste into new note
- Turn list into checkboxes

I’ve never had time to finish a game’s story in a short amount of time. I’m a very casual gamer, that loves the stories in some of these games. The problem is it usually takes me months to a year to complete a game. Especially since I play more than one at a time. Tracking the story progress, and checking off a chapter as I move forward, helps me understand how much I have left before completion.
