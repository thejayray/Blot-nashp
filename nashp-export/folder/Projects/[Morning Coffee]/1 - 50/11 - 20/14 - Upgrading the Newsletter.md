## Upgrading the Newsletter

I’ve been building up to this moment for awhile now. This is the week that the newsletter switches for everyone. No more having to click to read it. When you open the email you see the writing I did for that week. This has been in the making for months now. Hope you like it.

## Photoshoot

A few days ago, I did a [shoot](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODYxNDE3MTM4NzY5MDgy?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) for my friend Matt’s new motorcycle. Was some more practice with night photography. The next day I was able to practice with [my Instagram Stories](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODYxNDE3MTM4NzY5MDgy?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=). I like the way they came out.

My friend Richard started a [playlist](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/mood-muse-ic-vol-1/pl.u-6XvuZ6j4da) series last week. I helped him sequence it, calling myself the “executive producer” of the project. It’s inspired by the goddesses of Greek mythology.
